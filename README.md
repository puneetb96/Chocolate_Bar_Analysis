# Flavors of Cacao: Chocolate Bar Analysis


## Project Introduction
This project showcases data analysis skills by determining influencing factors of chocolate bar ratings based on many contributing factors such as cocoa percentage, bean origin, bean type, and company location. The "Flavors of Cacao" dataset was used from the open source Kaggle, and the analysis of regression, clustering and visualization was done in Python and Tableau. All this culiminated into a final Chocolate Bar Analysis preentation in a Tableau Storyboard to help offer insights into consumer preference and drive market strategy.
The final Tableau Presentation Storyboard is linked below:

## Objectives & Key Questions
The goal of this project is to explore patterns in chocolate bar ratings using the 'Flavors of Cacao' dataset. A deep dive into the dataset reveals what influencing factors produce the highest chocolate bar ratings based on cocoa bean origin, company location, cocoa percentage, and bean types. Using this expert review data, we can come to conclusions and recommendations on the best way to produce chocolate to optimize both consumption and production.

- Which countries/regions produce the highest quality cocoa bean?
- Is there a correlation between cocoa percentage and chocolate bar ratings?
- Are there specific bean types that produce higher ratings?
- Is there a cocoa percentage that tastes better or worse?


 ## Data and Tools Used
The "Flavors of Cacao" dataset was used for this project. It was open sourced from Kaggle, and the detailed summary documentation can be found in the "01-Project Management" folder above. This dataset includes over 1700 unique chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cacao, bean variety and where the beans were grown. These ratings were scored by cacao tasting experts. The ratings were compiled by Brady Brelinski, who is the Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society.

Python and Tableau were the main data analyst tools used for exploratory data analysis, data visualization, cleaning, and much more. THe following libraries are just some of the ones used in Python and Jupyter Notebooks under the "03-Scripts" folder above:


  - Pandas: For data analysis
  - Numpy: For numerical operations
  - OS: Interaction between operating system and Python, for file and directory operations
  - Matplotlib.pyplot: For plotting data values in graphical and data visualization formats
  - Seaborn: For more additional statistical data visualization
  - Scipy: For more advanced mathmatical and technical computing
  - Scikit-learn and Statsmodels: For regression models, clustering, and trend analysis
  - JSON: Geospatial analysis/visualization handeling


## Folders
The makeup of this project is divided into the following folder structures:

- 01-Project Managment: Project brief PDF and detailed Microsoft Word summary of open sourced 'Flavors of Cacao" Kaggle dataset
- 02-Data: Contains "Original Data" and "Prepared Data" subfolders for all portions of this project. Cleaned and merged CSV files were used for analysis
- 03-Scripts: All Python coding scripts in Jupyter notebooks used for analysis and visualization
- 04-Analysis: Under "Data Visualizations" subfolder, there contains all the data visualizations created in Python.
