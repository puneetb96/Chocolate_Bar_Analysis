# Flavors of Cacao: Chocolate Bar Analysis

## Project Introduction
This project showcases data analysis skills by determining influencing factors of chocolate bar ratings based on many contributing factors such as cocoa percentage, bean origin, bean type, and company location. The "Flavors of Cacao" dataset was used from the open source Kaggle, and the analysis of regression, clustering and visualization was done in Python and Tableau. All this culiminated into a final Chocolate Bar Analysis preentation in a Tableau Storyboard to help offer insights into consumer preference and drive market strategy.
The final Tableau Presentation Storyboard is linked below:

## Objectives & Key Questions
The goal of this project is to explore patterns in chocolate bar ratings using the 'Flavors of Cacao' dataset. A deep dive into the dataset reveals what influencing factors produce the highest chocolate bar ratings based on cocoa bean origin, company location, cocoa percentage, and bean types. Using this expert review data, we can come to conclusions and recommendations on the best way to produce chocolate to optimize both consumption and production.

- Which countries/regions produce the highest quality cocoa bean?
- Is there a correlation between cocoa percentage and chocolate bar ratings?
- Are there specific bean types that produce higher ratings?
- Is there a cocoa percentage that tastes better or worse?
